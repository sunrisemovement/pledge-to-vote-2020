Historic change is coming. The question is: will the forces of fear and hate bring us into a darker version of the past, or will our generation rise up and light the way forward?</p>\n<p>The answer is up to us.

We need a generational uprising that makes it clear to those in power that we won’t back down until our ideas are the law of the land.</p>\n<p>It won’t be easy. But a better world is within reach.
