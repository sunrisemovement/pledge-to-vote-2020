**We are on the cusp of transforming American politics forever.**

For years they said our generation is lazy and naive, that we ask for too much. They said the Green New Deal, defunding the police, ending evictions, and Medicare for All were never going to happen. But while they were asleep at the wheel, our generation was wide awake and building movements to make our vision a reality.

2021 can be the year our generation takes charge and sets our country’s priorities on the right track.

To get there, we need to defeat Donald Trump this November.

One November 3rd, our generation will log off, walk out and join our friends and neighbors in the streets and at the ballot box. We will vote and mobilize to protect the vote.

After that, we need to do everything in our power to make Joe Biden’s life a waking nightmare, and force his administration to act on our priorities and our agenda.

Our generation can change America forever, but it’s going to take all of us. *Are you in?*
